OpenVAS via Socks4 
Please test and review the patch.
You have to set some scanner preferences to get it working:
socks_use_proxy = yes
socks_proxy_host = <ip-address>
socks_proxy_port = <1080>
socks_proxy_type = <SOCKS4|SOCKS5>
socks_proxy_userid = <username>
socks_proxy_password = <password>

need a stable PID, if the session gets killed try a different PID
check proxychains.conf for matching entries
