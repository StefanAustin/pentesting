 Deploy a war file
 
 For this lesson, we’re going to introduce a tool called
“Laudanum,” and it’s ready-made “JSP War Shell.” 

cd /usr/share/laudanum/jsp

We’re specifically interested in the “jsp” files.
Within the “jsp” directory, we can already see a pre-compiled
“cmd.war” application that should be ready for use.

Upload this .war file and deploy it
browse to it
a command shell opens

now get a real reverse shell with NC
