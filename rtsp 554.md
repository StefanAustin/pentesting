Basic Information

The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is a network control protocol designed for use in entertainment and communications systems to control streaming media servers. 

A simple DESCRIBE request looks like:

DESCRIBE rtsp://ip:port RTSP/1.0\r\nCSeq: 2\r\n\r\n

If Digest authentication is required, then the 401 Unauthorizedresponse will have an information line containing WWW-Authenticate: Digest. The information with the Digest specification IS very important if you are going to do Digest authentication, so dont ignore it.

DESCRIBE rtsp://<ip>:<port> RTSP/1.0\r\nCSeq: 2\r\nAuthorization: Basic YWRtaW46MTIzNA==\r\n\r\n

The value YWRtaW46MTIzNA== is the base 64 encoded username and password concatenated with “:”. In this case I have used “admin”/”1234”. Some simple python scripting to try this out looks like:

### connect via python
import socket

req = "DESCRIBE rtsp://<ip>:<port> RTSP/1.0\r\nCSeq: 2\r\nAuthorization: Basic YWRtaW46MTIzNA==\r\n\r\n"

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

s.connect(("IP", 554))

s.sendall(req)

data = s.recv

print data

### Enumeration
nmap -sV --scripts "rtsp-*" -p PORT IP
