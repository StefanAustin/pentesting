## How to start

### Unusual start:
You want to make money with pentesting? Think about note taking (and report writing) very early. I use CherryTree to organize my notes, but you can use Joplin and other tools.
Document your findings with software like:

- greenshot (screenshot program)
- Cherrytree
- MS Note
- Joplin

Free tool for nice pictures and flowcharts

- drawio (https://draw-io.en.softonic.com/) -> if you use linux take it from github

### The OS

If possible use OVA files and import it into your virtual machine (VirtualBox)

- Kali Linux (https://www.kali.org/downloads/)
- Parrot (https://www.parrotsec.org/download/)
- BlackArch (https://www.blackarch.org/downloads.html)

I use Kali, because it is user friendly.

### Start with the basics and learn hands-on
INE's starter pass in an idea. It is free and has hands-on labs. (https://checkout.ine.com/starter-pass?utm_source=74&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=starterpass&utm_content=vip)

Networking is big, you have to unterstand it. Maybe watch Prof. Messers Net+ series on YouTube. 

### Do not skip any phase if you want to learn hacking
- Reconnaisance
- Enumeration
- Gaining Access
- Maintain access
- Covering tracks

People love hacking and breaking into systems, but the easiest way might be a password stored in a file. Enumeration is the key.

### If you do a test, think about the impact. 
What happens if I push this button?



A good starting point is nmap. Take this tool and scan your own machine at home and other devices. nmap is mostly passive and does not do anything... 
Really? Scan your printer...
